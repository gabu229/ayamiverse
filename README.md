# Ayamiverse (Demo)

## Introduction
Ayamiverse is a **Web3-powered anime Metaverse** where users can create, customize, and own unique anime-style characters. Built on blockchain technology, it allows players to **mint, evolve, and participate** in immersive quests and faction-driven storylines within a futuristic, story-rich universe.

Set in **Mizuki Academy**, a prestigious yet politically charged institution, users choose factions and engage in events that influence the broader narrative of the Ayamiverse. Every decision shapes character progression and the ecosystem, making it an interactive experience beyond just collectibles.

## Features
- **NFT-based Character Creation** – Mint and customize your own anime-inspired NFT characters.
- **Story-Driven Metaverse** – Engage in faction-driven conflicts in Mizuki Academy and beyond.
- **Evolution System** – Characters grow and change over time based on participation in quests.
- **Decentralized Economy** – Own, trade, and monetize in-game assets using blockchain.
- **Sybil-Resistant Reputation System** – Anti-bot measures ensure a fair player ecosystem.
- **Exclusive Events & Quests** – Limited-time missions with rewards that impact the storyline.
- **Community-Influenced Storyline** – Players' choices affect the world’s ongoing narrative.

## Tech Stack
